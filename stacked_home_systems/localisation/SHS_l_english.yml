    sc_b_1_desc:0 "§LThe large class B main-sequence stars are very bright and blue. Although somewhat rare, the luminosity of these stars make them some of the most visible to the naked eye.§!"
    sc_a_1:0 "§HClass A Star§!"
    sc_a_1_desc:0 "§LThese relatively young white or bluish-white main-sequence stars are typically among the most visible to the naked eye. They are large and rotate very quickly, but will eventually evolve into slower and cooler red giants.§!"
    sc_f_1:0 "§HClass F Star§!"
    sc_f_1_desc:0 "§LF-type stars are fairly large and often referred to as yellow-white dwarves. Although they often emit significant amounts of UV radiation, their wide habitable zones have a good chance of supporting life-bearing worlds.§!"
    sc_g_1:0 "§HClass G Star§!"
    sc_g_1_desc:0 "§LOften referred to as yellow dwarves, G-type stars actually range in color from white to slightly yellow. Main-sequence stars fuse hydrogen for roughly 10 billion years before they expand and become red giants. Although their lifespans are shorter than K-type stars, worlds inside the habitable zone of a G star often enjoy optimal conditions for the development of life.§!"
    sc_k_1:0 "§HClass K Star§!"
    sc_k_1_desc:0 "§LThese main-sequence stars, sometimes referred to as orange dwarves, are a fairly common sight. They are stable on the main-sequence for up to 30 billion years, meaning that worlds orbiting a K-type star have a longer than average window to evolve life.§!"
    sc_m_1:0 "§HClass M Star§!"
    sc_m_1_desc:0 "§LThe most common stars in the universe, often referred to as red dwarves. Their low luminosity means they are difficult to observe with the naked eye from afar. Although they typically have an extremely long lifespan, red dwarves emit almost no UV light resulting in unfavorable conditions for most forms of life.§!"
    sc_black_hole_1:0 "§HBlack Hole§!"
    sc_black_hole_1_desc:0 "§LTypically formed as a result of the collapse of a very massive star at the end of its life cycle, black holes have extremely strong gravity fields that prevent anything - including light - from escaping once the event horizon has been crossed.§!"
    sc_neutron_star_1:0 "§HNeutron Star§!"
    sc_neutron_star_1_desc:0 "§LThese incredibly dense stellar remnants are sometimes created when a massive star suffers a rapid collapse and explodes in a supernova. Although their diameter is typically as little as ten kilometers, their mass is many times greater than an average G-type star.§!"
    sc_pulsar_1:0 "§HPulsar§!"
    sc_pulsar_1_desc:0 "§LPulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. As the star rotates, the radiation beam is only visible when it is pointing directly at the observer. This results in a very precise interval of pulses, which sometimes is so exact that it can be used to measure the passage of time with extreme accuracy.§!"

The Civilization that built them does not appear to have been here for at least 100,000 years judging by the age of the oldest debris, but the information that these satellites may still harbour could still be valuable."

These buildings seemed to have broken down over time, and now serve no purpose but to impede our growth on this Gift of a Ringworld."
